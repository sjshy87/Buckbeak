Phoenix is a geo-temporal analysis tool designed to be relatively agnostic to the data itself. 
All data will be adapted to its own internal format that treats individual records as time-series
data to be binned by 'entity'. Each property in the input stream for a given entity is treated as
its own time-series, allowing for trend analysts, playback, and visualization of trends as well
as change detection.

While it is primarily focused on geo-temporal data containing multiple entities, any temporal data
can be used with this tool. 

## Adding a source

## Styling

Styling is done in one of two ways: via the SASS pre-processor, and via styled-components. Phoenix 
uses Bootstrap 4 where possible. 

### Styling with SASS

Generally speaking, SASS should be used to style nested elements from 3rd party libraries, and to
define variables for use within styled-components (more on that later). As such, you should avoid
doing much styling in here. We include SASS primarily to simplify the process of customizing/themeing
Bootstrap, and to provide a consistent way of defining variables that can be re-used by components.
The `stylesheets` folder is organized as

- `base` - Any core, generic CSS. Usage should be limited only to broad/global styling.
- `themes` - The styles for specific themes. This is split out into
  - `theme` - The name of a specific theme
    - `all` - The main import of the theme. Includes variables (below) and 3rd party themed imports
    - `variables` - The shared variables. This is separated out so it can easily be imported for themeing of styled components
- `utils` - Generic SASS components for use in helping to define variables 
  - `functions` - SASS functions
  - `helpers` - SASS helpers    
  - `mixins` - SASS mixins
- `vendors` - 3rd party imports and overrides that do not depend on themeing 

### Styling with styled-components

This is how most things we write should be styled. More on this later, but for now see examples 
in the components folder

## How to organize a module

Modules define high level functionality. At a minimum, they should include Redux actions and reducers,
but may contain Epics (see `redux-observable`), components, and constants. Generally speaking

- Actions should define the action names as well as functions that wrap action creators.
- Reducers should only handle state. You may define epics in here
- Epics should be used to generate additional actions from actions. An example is querying. When a query is creatd, it should create a new collection, start an adapter, and emit updates to the collection based on normalized data from the adapter
